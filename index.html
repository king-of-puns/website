        <h2>A Short Introduction</h2>
        <p>What's up, everybody? My name is Kingsley, and I like coding. In particular, web development is the most appealing to me for its ease and what it can become. I have done a 120-hour project on web development.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to play some video games. One game I play is Mario Kart, and you can see some of my clips below (click on the image.)</p>
